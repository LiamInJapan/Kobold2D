// By adding another @interface with the same name of the class but adding an identifier in brackets
// you can define private class methods. These are methods which are only used in this class and should
// not be used by other classes. Adding these method definitions gets rid of the "may not respond to selector"
// warning messages. The warning messages are not the problem, the problem is when the warning holds true
// and one of the selectors really can't respond. Typically due to a spelling mistake. In that case the App
// would simply crash. It's good practice to get rid of "may not respond to selector" warnings since they can
// be important indicators to potential crashes.
