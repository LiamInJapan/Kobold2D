	// Adding NSView objects to Cocos2D Mac has unresolved issues, it's not working.
	// If you want to help out, or know the solution, please contact: steffen@learn-cocos2d.com
	// Please read the remainder to get more clues about what is known and has been tried.
	
	// Problem: adding subviews crashes in drawScene, or rendering is corrupt.
	
	// The recommended solution should be to call setWantsLayer:YES (see this demo project: http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#samplecode/LayerBackedOpenGLView/Introduction/Intro.html)
	// However it appears that the Cocos2D OpenGL View is not cooperative and violates at least one of the principles described
	// in NSView setWantsLayer: http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSView_Class/Reference/NSView.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSView/setWantsLayer:
	// The alternative solution (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2221442/nstextfield-over-nsopenglview/2221515#2221515)
	// was unsuccessful as well. It has also been discussed in the cocos2d forum: http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/forum/topic/12077

	// If you manage to render NSView on top of the cocos2d OpenGL view please let me know!

	// both layer hosted and layer backed approaches crash in drawScene when calling glClear
	//CALayer* layer = [[[CALayer alloc] init] autorelease];
	//[[CCDirector sharedDirector].openGLView setLayer:layer];
	
	// layer backed (comment out the above 2 lines)
