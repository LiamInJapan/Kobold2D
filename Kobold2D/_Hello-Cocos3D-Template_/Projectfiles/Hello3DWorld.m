/**
 * Constructs the 3D world.
 *
 * Adds 3D objects to the world, loading a 3D 'hello, world' message
 * from a POD file, and creating the camera and light programatically.
 *
 * When adapting this template to your application, remove all of the content
 * of this method, and add your own to construct your 3D model world.
 *
 * NOTE: The POD file used for the 'hello, world' message model is fairly large,
 * because converting a font to a mesh results in a LOT of triangles. When adapting
 * this template project for your own application, REMOVE the POD file 'hello-world.pod'
 * from the Resources folder of your project!!

/**
 * This template method is invoked periodically whenever the 3D nodes are to be updated.
 *
 * This method provides this node with an opportunity to perform update activities before
 * any changes are applied to the transformMatrix of the node. The similar and complimentary
 * method updateAfterTransform: is automatically invoked after the transformMatrix has been
 * recalculated. If you need to make changes to the transform properties (location, rotation,
 * scale) of the node, or any child nodes, you should override this method to perform those
 * changes.
 *
 * The global transform properties of a node (globalLocation, globalRotation, globalScale)
 * will not have accurate values when this method is run, since they are only valid after
 * the transformMatrix has been updated. If you need to make use of the global properties
 * of a node (such as for collision detection), override the udpateAfterTransform: method
 * instead, and access those properties there.
 *
 * The specified visitor encapsulates the CC3World instance, to allow this node to interact
 * with other nodes in its world.
 *
 * The visitor also encapsulates the deltaTime, which is the interval, in seconds, since
 * the previous update. This value can be used to create realistic real-time motion that
 * is independent of specific frame or update rates. Depending on the setting of the
 * maxUpdateInterval property of the CC3World instance, the value of dt may be clamped to
 * an upper limit before being passed to this method. See the description of the CC3World
 * maxUpdateInterval property for more information about clamping the update interval.
 *
 * As described in the class documentation, in keeping with best practices, updating the
 * model state should be kept separate from frame rendering. Therefore, when overriding
 * this method in a subclass, do not perform any drawing or rending operations. This
 * method should perform model updates only.
 *
 * This method is invoked automatically at each scheduled update. Usually, the application
 * never needs to invoke this method directly.
