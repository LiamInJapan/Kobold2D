/** KKPixelMaskSprite is a CCSprite that has a pixelMask for pixel-perfect collision detection.
 
 Notable behavior of this class:
 - Each instance creates its own pixelMask, even though the same texture may already be loaded.
 - Can only compare HD vs HD or SD vs SD images, but not HD vs SD images.
 - Can not be created from spriteframe or spriteframe name.
 .
 
 These may be fixed at a later time given enough interest.

@interface KKPixelMaskSprite : CCSprite
{
	// Some useful improvements to this implementation would be:
	// cache pixelMasks for the same filename, to avoid wasting memory (much like CCTextureCache)
	// allow pixel mask to be created from a sprite frame
	// allow collisions between SD and HD assets (atm pixelMasks must be either both SD or both HD, collision tests return wrong results otherwise)
	// allow collisions if one or both sprites are rotated by exactly 90, 180 or 270 degrees
	
	// Possible optimizations:
	// reduce pixelMask size by combining the result of 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, etc pixel blocks into a single collision bit
	//	such a downscaled pixelMask would still be accurate enough for most use cases but require considerably less memory and is faster to iterate
	//	however picking a good algorithm that determines if a bit is set or not can be tricky
	// optimizing rectangle test: read multiple bits at once (byte or int), only compare individual bits if value > 0
	
	// Non-trivial improvement:
	// move the pixelMask array to CCTexture2D, to avoid loading the same image twice and take advantage of CCTextureCache
	// allow pixel perfect collisions if one or both nodes are rotated and/or scaled
	//		suggest using the render texture approach instead, as described here: http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/forum/topic/18522
	// for purely "walking over landscape" type of games (think Tiny Wings but with an arbitrarily complex and rugged terrain),
	//	the pixelMask could be changed to contain only the pixel height (first pixel from top that's not alpha)
	//	That modification should be a separate class, labelled something like KKSpriteWithHeightMask.
