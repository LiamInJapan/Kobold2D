cocos2d-extensions
==================

This is a library containing only API enhancements for cocos2d-iphone.

The project extends only existing Cocos2D classes via Objective-C categories. 
This way we can easily patch in additional methods to the Cocos2D API without having to modify Cocos2D itself. 
New classes not directly extending existing cocos2d classes should be added to the Kobold2Dâ„¢ project instead.

Note: this project is NOT the official cocos2d-iphone-extensions project.
