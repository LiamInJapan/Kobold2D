/** The color format of the OpenGL View.
 
 Valid config.lua values for this setting are:
 - GLViewColorFormat.RGBA8888
 - GLViewColorFormat.RGB565
 .
 
 RGBA8888 is 32-bit with alpha channel, RGB565 is 16-bit with no alpha channel. RGB565 is the default because it is faster and sufficient for most uses. RGBA8888 provides the best visual quality in particular for images with gradients, and it allows the OpenGL view itself to be transparent which is required if you want to have UIKit views in the background (behind the Cocos2D view).
 */

/** The depth (z-buffering) format of the OpenGL View. 
 
 Valid config.lua values for this setting are:
 - 0
 - GLViewDepthFormat.DepthNone
 - GLViewDepthFormat.Depth16Bit
 - GLViewDepthFormat.Depth24Bit
 .
 
 Depth buffering is normally not needed and reduces rendering performance, so the default value is DepthNone (equals 0). Depth16Bit and Depth24Bit set the depth (Z) buffer to 16-bit respectively 24-bit (more accurate, higher memory usage). If you want to use Cocos3D, 3D or Grid Actions (eg PageTurn3D), or isometric tilemaps (and in some cases orthogonal tilemaps) you should enable depth buffering. Prefer to use a 16-bit buffer unless you see artifacts, in that case a 24-bit buffer may help.
 */

/** Enable multisampling (anti-aliasing) for edge removal. On older iOS devices multisampling can noticeably reduce rendering performance. See also: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multisample_anti-aliasing
 
 For Mac OS computers consider allowing the user to change this setting as the performance and visual quality greatly depends on the graphics card and screen resolution.
 */
@property (nonatomic) BOOL gLViewMultiSampling;

/** If multisampling is enabled, sets the number of samples. On iOS devices valid values are 1, 2 and 4. On Mac OS this depends on the graphics card and you may be able to use 8 or 16 as well. */
@property (nonatomic) int gLViewNumberOfSamples;

/** Specifies the pixel format for all textures. By default all textures are 24-bit with 8-bit alpha but if you reduce the color bit depth of your textures and don't need an alpha channel you can preserve half the texture memory. The TexturePacker tool http://www.texturepacker.com will help you with this.
 
 Valid config.lua values for this setting are:
 - TexturePixelFormat.Automatic
 - TexturePixelFormat.RGBA8888
 - TexturePixelFormat.RGB565
 - TexturePixelFormat.A8
 - TexturePixelFormat.I8
 - TexturePixelFormat.IA88
 - TexturePixelFormat.RGBA4444
 - TexturePixelFormat.RGB5A1
 - TexturePixelFormat.PVRTC4
 - TexturePixelFormat.PVRTC2
 .
 
 The Automatic mode defaults to RGBA8888 which is the default texture pixel format (24-bit colors, 8-bit alpha). Compatible and using half the memory is RGBA4444 which has 12-bit colors and 4-bit alpha, and obviously reduced image quality. A better alternative would be RGB565 which gives you 16-bit colors but no alpha, or RGB5A1 which gives you 15-bit colors and at least 1-bit alpha. This means your images can have "see-through" parts but each pixel can be either completely translucent or completely opaque. This is good enough for sprite masks. The pixel format A8 is used by particle effects by default, it provides 256 colors (8-bit). Useful for single-color textures when you really need to preserve memory and faster performance than 16-bit or 32-bit textures.

/** Sets the type of director to use for your iOS game. This setting is ignored on Mac OS. The director type affects how the game update loop is run, and can affect the game's overall performance and impose technical limitations.
 
 Valid config.lua values for this setting are:
 - DirectorType.NSTimer
 - DirectorType.MainLoop
 - DirectorType.ThreadMainLoop
 - DirectorType.DisplayLink
 .
 
 The DisplayLink director type is the default and recommended. If your app targets iOS 3.1 or higher you should only use the DisplayLink director type. The NSTimer director type is quite slow, it may not even achieve 60 fps without rendering anything. But it is the most compatible and would still work on iOS 2.x. The MainLoop directors are aggressive versions of the timer director, pushing the framerate up but they don't cooperate with UIKit views since they consume all available CPU time. The ThreadMainLoop director may be a bit better in that regard. But overall you should avoid the MainLoop director types.
 */
@property (nonatomic) int directorType;

/** Just in case the directorType is set to DirectorType.DisplayLink you can specify an alternate, fallback director type for devices running iOS 3.0 or older. Usually this is set to DirectorType.NSTimer which will result in sub-par performance for devices running iOS 3.0 or older. It is recommended to simply target iOS 3.1 as your deployment target instead.

 - DirectorType.NSTimer
 - DirectorType.MainLoop
 - DirectorType.ThreadMainLoop
 - DirectorType.DisplayLink

 - Portrait: Home button on bottom

@property (nonatomic) int deviceOrientation;

/** Sets the maximum framerate of your game. Defaults to 60.
 
 On iOS Devices the maximum framerate is limited to 60 frames per second by the display hardware. On Mac OS you may be able to go higher but at little benefit, 60 fps is already very, very smooth.
 
 Note that this setting can not magically increase your framerate. But you can intentionally limit your app's framerate to a lower framerate, in particular if your app is experiencing a highly fluctuating framerate. If you see the framerate counter jump between 40 to 60 fps it can be helpful to limit the framerate to 40 fps since a steady framerate is very important, in particular for some games. You also reduce the number of times your game is updated, which in turn may even result in a slightly better performance.
 
 Note that on iOS with the DirectorType.DisplayLink you can only expect to get a framerate of 60, 30 (60 divided by 2), 20 (60 divided by 3), 15 (60 divided by 4), 12 (60 divided by 5), and so on. The DisplayLink director links the update rate to the screen refresh rate. If the update takes just tiny bit longer than 16.666 milliseconds the DisplayLink director will have to skip this frame and will only refresh the screen after 33.333 milliseconds. That's why it can be very important for DisplayLink director to limit the framerate to 30 fps if your app frequently drops below 60 fps. You'll get a stable framerate and twice the CPU time per frame.

Keep in mind that the FPS for iOS apps running in the iOS Simulator is not indicative of real performance on the device (it could be ten times that, or one tenth). Also logging and an attached debugger (running from within Xcode) can negatively affect performance.
 
 Important: when enabling this setting you must have the file fps_images.png in your project's resources. Otherwise your app will report an error on startup.
 
 To change how often the FPS counter is updated, open the ccConfig.h file (of Cocos2D) and look for the macro CC_DIRECTOR_FPS_INTERVAL.
