/** The Kobold2D equivalent of the UITouch class contains the same information as a UITouch. The locations are already converted
 to the Cocos2D view coordinate space, you should *not* call convertToGL on the KKTouch locations. Touches are pooled to avoid frequent alloc/dealloc cycles as fingers
 touch the screen and are lifted back up again.
 
 The touchID property is a unique identifier for a particular finger that touches the screen. 
 The touchID is simply the UITouch* pointer cast to NSUInteger, so you can get to the UITouch* if needed by casting touchID to UITouch*: UITouch* uiTouch = (UITouch*)(kkTouch.touchID);
