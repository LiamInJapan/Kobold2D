 * Adds a die cube that can be rotated by the user touching it and then swiping in any

 * to the speed and length of the swipe, and then steadily slows down over time.
 *
 * While the user is touching the cube and moving the finger, the die cube is rotated
 * under direct finger motion. Once the finger is lifted, the die cube spins in a
 * freewheel fashion, and slows down over time due to friction.
 *
 * This die cube does not use a CCAction to rotate. Instead, a custom SpinningNode class
 * replaces the node loaded from the POD file. This custom class spins by adjusting its
 * rotational state on each update pass. It contains a spinSpeed property to indicate how
 * fast it is currently spinning, and a friction property to adjust the spinSpeed on each
 * update.
 *
 * To handle the behaviour of the node while it is freewheeling, we create it as a
 * specialized subclass. Since this node is loaded from a POD file, one way to do this
 * is to load the POD class and then copy it to the subclass we want. That is done here.
 *
 * To rotate a node using changes in rotation using the rotateBy... family of methods,
 * as is done to this node, does NOT requre a specialized class. This specialized class
 * is required to handle the freewheeling and friction nature of the behaviour after the
 * rotation has begun.
