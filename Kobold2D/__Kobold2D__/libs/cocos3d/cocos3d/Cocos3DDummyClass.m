// This class only exists to be able to be able to link the cocos3d static library.
// Currently cocos3d does not build any of the cocos3d code because it is incompatible with cocos2d 2.x.
// But since a static library is required to contain at least some code, this dummy class was added.
// I could have removed the cocos3d library entirely, but decided against it because it'll make it easier
// to add cocos3d back in once it is compatible with cocos2d 2.x.
