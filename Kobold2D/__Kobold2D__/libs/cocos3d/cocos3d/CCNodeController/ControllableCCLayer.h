 * if it exists, permitting "augmented reality" displays
 *
 * This layer is a subclass of CCLayerColor, but may be initialized to behave as either
 * a CCLayerColor or a basic CCLayer, respectively, by using the initWithColor:width:height:
 * method to create a backdrop color and blend, or the basic init method to initialize
 * without a backdrop color or blend.
 *
 * Since layers generally cover the whole screen, the initial value of the
 * alignContentSizeWithDeviceOrientation property is YES, indicating that, by default,
 * this layer will rotate its contentSize as the device orientation changes between
 * portrait and landscape.
 *
 * When overlaying the device camera, this layer will use a transparent GL clear color
 * and will not draw any backdrop color blend. When not overlaying the device camera,
 * this layer will use opaque black as the GL clear color, and will draw a backdrop color
 * blend if it has been configured with one.
