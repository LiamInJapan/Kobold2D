#pragma mark Device camera support

/** Indicates whether this device supports a camera. */
@property(nonatomic, readonly) BOOL isDeviceCameraAvailable;

/**
 * Controls whether the controlled CCNode is overlaying the view of the device camera.
 * The value of this property is initially set to NO.
 * This property can only be set to YES if a camera is actually available on the device.
 *
 * If the device supports a camera, setting this property to YES will cause the controller
 * to immediately open a view of the device camera and overlay the CCNode view on top of
 * the device camera view. 
 * 
 * Setting this property to NO will cause the controller to close the device camera
 * (if it was open) and display the CCNode without the camera background.
 *
 * Converting back and forth between the device camera overlay and a normal view is not
 * a trivial activity. The simple act of changing this property causes the following
 * sequence of actions:
 *
 *   - If the CCNode is currently running, it is sent an onExit message to cause it to
 *     stop running, clean up any active actions, and reset its touch event handling.
 *     CCNode subclasses can also override onExit to perform other activities associated
 *     with cleaning up prior to the overlay changing.
 *
 *   - This controller is sent a willChangeIsOverlayingDeviceCamera message.
 *
 *   - The isOverlayingDeviceCamera property of this controller is changed.
 *
 *   - If the isOverlayingDeviceCamera property is being set to YES, the picker
 *     UIImagePickerController is presented modally. If the isOverlayingDeviceCamera
 *     property is being set to NO, the modal picker UIImagePickerController is dismissed.
 *
 *   - This controller is sent a didChangeIsOverlayingDeviceCamera message.
 *
 *   - If the CCNode was running, it is sent an onEnter message to cause it to restart,
 *     be ready for actions, and, in the case of CCLayers, re-register for touch events.
 *     CCNode subclasses can also override onEnter to perform other activities associated
 *     with adjusting their world following the overlay changing (such as hiding or showing
 *     child CCNodes based on whether or not the device camera is now overlayed.
