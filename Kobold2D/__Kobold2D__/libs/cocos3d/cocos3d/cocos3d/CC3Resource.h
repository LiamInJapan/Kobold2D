/**
 * CC3Resource is a wrapper class around a resource structure loaded from a data file
 * containing 3D resources. It handles loading object data from files, and creating
 * CC3Nodes from that data.
 *
 * This is an abstract class. Specific subclasses will load files of specific types.
 *
 * Of the methods defined in this class, subclasses must override the primitive
 * template method loadFromFile:. Other methods defined by this class have been
 * implemented using this primitive method. As a result, subclasses do not need
 * to override any of the other methods defined by this class.
 *
 * Access to 3D data objects loaded from the file is through the nodes property,
 * which contains the root nodes of a structural 3D node assembly constructed from
 * the 3D data loaded from the file. Subclasses should ensure that the nodes array
 * property is fully populated upon successful completion of the loadFromFile: method.

 * whether the loading was successful.
 *
 * This is a template method. This implementation performs the following:
 *   - Tests that a file has not already been loaded into this instance, and logs
 *     an error if it has.
 *   - Logs the header information for loading this resource.
 *   - If the name property of this instance has not been set, sets it from the
 *     name of the file as extracted from the specified file path.
 *   - If the directory property of this instance has not been set, sets it from
 *     the directory path as extracted from the specified file path.
 *
 * Subclasses must override this method to perform the actual file loading,
 * parsing, and node extraction, but should be sure to invoke this superclass
 * implementation to ensure the above tasks are performed.
 * 
 * Once this method has been successfully invoked, the application may immediately
 * access the nodes property to retrieve the node assemblies contained in this resource.
