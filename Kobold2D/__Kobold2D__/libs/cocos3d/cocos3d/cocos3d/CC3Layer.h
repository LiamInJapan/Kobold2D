/**
 * CC3Layer is a cocos2d CCLayer that supports full 3D rendering in combination with normal
 * cocos2d 2D rendering. It forms the bridge between the 2D and 3D drawing environments.
 *
 * The CC3Layer contains an instance of CC3World, and delegates all 3D operations, for both
 * updating and drawing 3D models, to the CC3World instance.
 *
 * In addition, like any cocos2d CCLayer, 2D child CCNodes can be added to this layer and
 * will be rendered either over or under the 3D world, based on their individual Z-order.
 * In particular, 2D controls such as menus, sprites, labels, health bars, joysticks, etc,
 * can be overlayed on the 3D world simply by adding them as children of this layer.
 * Similarly, a 2D backdrop could be rendered behind the 3D world by adding an appropriate
 * CCNode as a child with a negative Z-order.
 *
 * Like other CCNodes, this layer can be added to another 2D node, and given a contentSize,
 * position, and scale. You can even dynamically move and scale the embedded CC3Layer
 * using CCActions.
 *
 * Changes to the position and scale of the CC3Layer are propagated to the viewport of the
 * contained CC3World, and to any child CC3Layers and CC3Worlds.
 *
 * However, these properties will only be propagated if the node being moved is a CC3Layer.
 * If the CC3Layer is a child of a regular 2D CCLayer or  CCNode, and that node is moved,
 * the resulting changes to the position or scale of the child CC3Layer may not
 * automatically be propagated to the CC3World viewport. In this case, you can use the
 * updateViewport method of CC3Layer to ensure that the CC3World viewport is aligned
 * with the position and scale of the CC3Layer.
 *
 * CC3Layer descends from CCLayerColor, and will draw a colored background behind both 2D
 * and 3D content if configured with a background color.
 *
 * To make use of the standard cocos2d model updatating functionality to update and animate
 * the 3D world, use the scheduleUpdate or schedule:interval: methods of CC3Layer to invoke
 * periodic callbacks to the update: method of the CC3Layer instance. The update: method
 * forwards these callbacks to the CC3World instance held by the CC3Layer.
 *
 * To enable simple single-touch event handling for this layer, set the isTouchEnabled
 * property to YES. Once enabled, single-touch events will automatically be forwarded to
 * the touchEvent:at: method on your customized CC3World instance to support user selection
 * of 3D nodes via touches. For more information on handling 3D node selections, see the
 * description of the method nodeSelected:byTouchEvent:at: of CC3World.
 *
 * Since the touch-move events are both voluminous and seldom used, the implementation
 * of ccTouchMoved:withEvent: has been left out of the default CC3Layer implementation.
 * To receive and handle touch-move events for object picking, copy the commented-out
 * ccTouchMoved:withEvent: template method implementation in CC3Layer to your customized
 * CC3Layer subclass.
 *
 * For more sophisticated touch interfaces, such as multi-touch events or gestures, add
 * event-handing behaviour to your customized CC3Layer, as you would for any cocos2d
 * application and, when required, invoke the touchEvent:at: method on your customized
 * CC3World to initiate node selection.
 *
 * Most 3D games will be displayed in full-screen mode, so typically your custom CC3Layer
 * will be sized to cover the entire screen. However, the CC3Layer can indeed be set to a
 * contentSize less that the full window size, and may be positioned on the window, or
 * within a parent CCLayer like any other CCNode.
 * 
 * You can even dyanamically move your CC3Layer around within the window, by changing the
 * position property (for example, by using a CCMoveTo action).
 *
 * CC3Layer directly descends from ControllableCCLayer, which means that it can optionally
 * be controlled by a CCNodeController instance. Doing so enables two features:
 *   - Automatic rotatation the layer (both the 2D and 3D components) when the device
 *     orientation changes.
 *   - The CC3Layer can be overlaid on a device camera image stream so that both the 2D and
 *     3D worlds can participate in an augmented reality view perspective.
 *
 * With the CCNodeController attached, either or both of these features can be turned on
 * or off. If neither of these features is required, there is no need to instantiate and
 * attach a CCNodeController, and the CC3Layer can be used without it.
 *
 * For most applications, you will create subclasses of both CC3Layer and CC3World.
 * The customized subclass of CC3World manages the behaviour of the 3D resources.
 * The customized subclass of CC3Layer manages the 2D artifacts, such as menus, sprites,
 * labels, health bars, joysticks, etc, that you want to overlay on the 3D scene.
 *
 * Typically, you will create a separate instance of CC3World for each 3D scene. You can
 * also create a distinct CC3Layer for each scene as well or, more typically, reuse a single
 * CC3Layer instance across multiple CC3World scenes by simply assigning a differnt CC3World
 * instance to the layer. Any running actions in the old world are automatically paused,
 * and any running actions in the new world are automatically started. For more information
 * on swapping 3D scenes, see the notes on the cc3World property.
 * 
 * To create and use your CC3Layer and CC3World pair, follow these steps:
 *   -# Instantiate your CC3World class, including creating or loading 3D file resources
 *      in the initializeWorld method.
 *   -# Instantiate your CC3Layer subclass, adding any 2D controls in the initializeControls method.
 *   -# Attach your CC3World to the cc3World property of your CC3Layer.
 *   -# Invoke the play method of your CC3World to enable dynamic behaviour for the 3D world.
 *   -# Schedule regular updates in your CC3Layer instance by invoking either the
 *      scheduleUpdate or schedule:interval: method.
 *   -# Optionally create a CCNodeController.
 *   -# Run your CC3Layer instance either by invoking the runSceneOnNode: method of the
 *      CCNodeController with your CC3Layer, or by wrapping your CC3Layer in a CCScene
 *      and invoking the runWithScene: method of the shared CCDirector instance.

/**

 *
 * If your application contains multiple 3D scenes, you can swap between these scenes
 * by simply setting the value of this property to the new scene. The old CC3World
 * instance is released. So if you want to swap that old world back into this layer
 * at some point in the future, you should cache it somewhere, or recreated it.
 *
 * When the old world is released, it will clean up after itself, including all the
 * nodes and meshes it contains.
 *
 * If this layer already has a CC3World assigned, the wasRemoved method of the existing
 * CC3World to stop and remove any CCActions running on it and the nodes it contains.
 *
 * You can set the shouldCleanupWhenRemoved of the CC3World to NO if you want the
 * CCActions attached to the world and its nodes to be paused, but not stopped and
 * removed. Be aware that CCActions that are paused, but not stopped, will retain the
 * CC3World, and could be cause for memory leaks if not managed correctly. Please see
 * the notes of the CC3Node shouldCleanupWhenRemoved property and the CC3Node wasRemoved
 * method for more information.
 *
 * Setting this property automatically invokes the udpateWorld method on the new world
 * to ensure that the transforms are up to date before the next frame is rendered.
