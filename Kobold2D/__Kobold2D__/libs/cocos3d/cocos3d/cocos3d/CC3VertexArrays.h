#pragma mark CC3VertexArray

/**
 * CC3VertexArray manages the data associated with an aspect of a vertex. CC3VertexArray
 * is an abstract implementation, and there are several sublcasses, each specialized to
 * manage the vertex data for a different vertex aspect (locations, normals, colors,
 * texture mapping, indices...).
 *
 * Each instance of a subclass of CC3VertexArray maintains a reference to the underlying
 * vertex data in memory, along with various parameters describing the underlying data,
 * such as its type, element size, stride, etc.
 *
 * The underlying data can be interleaved and shared by several CC3VertexArray subclasses,
 * each looking at a different aspect of the data for each vertex. In this case, the
 * elements property of each of those vertex array instances will reference the same
 * underlying data memory, and the elementOffset property of each CC3VertexArray instance
 * will indicate at which offset in each vertex data the datum of interest to that instance
 * is located.
 *
 * The CC3VertexArray instance also manages buffering the data to the GL engine, including
 * loading it into a server-side GL vertex buffer object (VBO) if desired. Once loaded into
 * the GL engine buffers, the underlying data can be released from the CC3VertexArray instance,
 * thereby freeing memory, by using the releaseRedundantData method.
 *
 * The CC3DrawableVertexArray abstract subclass adds the functionality to draw the vertex
 * data to the display through the GL engine.
 *
 * When drawing the vertices to the GL engine, each subclass remembers which vertices were
 * last drawn, and only binds the vertices to the GL engine when a different set of vertices
 * of the same type are drawn. This allows the application to organize the CC3MeshNodes
 * within the CC3World so that nodes using the same mesh vertices are drawn together, before
 * moving on to other meshes. This strategy can minimize the number of vertex pointer
 * switches in the GL engine, which improves performance.
 *
 * Vertex arrays support the NSCopying protocol, but in normal operation, the need to create
 * copies of vertex arrays is rare.
 *
 * By default, when a mesh node is copied, it does not make a separate copy of its model.
 * Both the original and the copy make use of the same mesh instance. Similarly, when
 * a mesh is copied, it does not make separate copies of its vertex arrays. Instead,
 * both the original and the copy make use of the same vertex array instances.
 *
 * However, in some cases, such as populating a mesh from a template and then manipulating
 * the contents of each resulting mesh individually, creating copies of vertex arrays can
 * be useful.
 *
 * If you do find need to create a copy of a vertex array, you can do so by invoking the
 * copy method. However, you should take care to understand several points about copying
 * vertex arrays:
 *   - Copying a vertex array creates a full copy of the vertex data. This may consume
 *     significant memory.
 *   - The vertex data is copied for each vertex array copy. If several vertex arrays
 *     share interleaved data, multiple copies of that data will be created. This is almost
 *     never what you intend to do, and results in significant redundant data in memory.
 *     Instead, consider creating a copy of one of the vertex arrays, and then manually
 *     populating the others so that the interleaved vertex data can be shared.
 *   - If the value of the shouldReleaseRedundantData property of the original vertex
 *     array is YES and releaseRedundantData has been invoked, there will be no vertex
 *     data to be copied.
 *   - The new vertex array will not have a GL vertex buffer object associated with it.
 *     To buffer the vertex data of the new vertex array, invoke the createGLBuffer method
 *     on the new vertex array.

/**
 * Defines the rectangular area of the texture that should be mapped to the mesh.
 *
 * This property facilitates the use of sprite-sheets, where the mesh is covered
 * by a small fraction of a larger texture. This technique has many uses, including
 * animating a texture onto a mesh, where each section of the full texture is really
 * a different frame of a texture animation, or simply loading one larger texture
 * and using parts of it to texture many different meshes.
 *
 * The dimensions of this rectangle are taken as fractional portions of the full
 * area of the texture. Therefore, a rectangle with zero origin, and unit size
 * ((0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 1.0)) indicates that the mesh should be covered with the
 * complete texture.
 * 
 * A rectangle of smaller size, and/or a non-zero origin, indicates that the mesh
 * should be covered by a fractional area of the texture. For example, a rectangular
 * value for this property with origin at (0.5, 0.5), and size of (0.5, 0.5) indicates
 * that only the top-right quarter of the texture will be used to cover this mesh.
 *
 * The bounds of the texture rectangle must fit within a unit rectangle. Both the
 * bottom-left and top-right corners must lie between zero and one in both the
 * X and Y directions.
 *
 * The dimensions of the rectangle in this property are independent of the size
 * specified in the  alignWithTextureMapSize: and alignWithInvertedTextureMapSize:
 * methods. A unit rectangle value for this property will automatically take into
 * consideration the adjustment made to the mesh by those methods, and will display
 * only the part of the texture defined by them. Rectangular values for this property
 * that are smaller than the unit rectangle will be relative to the displayable area
 * defined by alignWithTextureMapSize: and alignWithInvertedTextureMapSize:.
 *
 * As an example, if the alignWithTextureMapSize: method was used to limit the mesh
 * to using only 80% of the texture (perhaps when using a non-POT texture), and this
 * property was set to a rectangle with origin at (0.5, 0.0) and size (0.5, 0.5),
 * the mesh will be covered by the bottom-right quarter of the usable 80% of the
 * overall texture.

 * Configures the mesh so that a texture applied to this mesh will be repeated the

 * argument contains two numbers, corresponding to how many times in each dimension
 * the texture should be repeated.
 * 
 * As an example, a value of (1, 2) for the repeatValue indicates that the texture
 * should repeat twice vertically, but not repeat horizontally.
 * 
 * When a texture is repeated, the corresponding side of the texture covering this
 * mesh must have a length that is a power-of-two, otherwise the padding added by
 * iOS to convert it to a power-of-two length internally will be visible in the
 * repeating pattern across the mesh.
 *
 * For a side that is not repeating, the corresponding side of the texture covering
 * this mesh does not require a length that is a power-of-two.
 *
 * The textureParameters property of any texture covering this mesh should include
 * the GL_REPEAT setting in each of its texture wrap components that correspond to
 * a repeatFactor greater than one. The GL_REPEAT setting is the default setting
 * for CC3Texture.
 *
 * For example, if you want to repeat your texture twice in one dimension, but only
 * once in the other, then you would use a repeatFactor of (1, 2) or (2, 1). For the
 * side that is repeating twice, the length of that side of the texture must be a
 * power-of-two. But the other side may have any dimension. The textureParameters
 * property of the CC3Texture should include the GL_REPEAT setting for the
 * corresponding texture dimension.
 * 
 * If your texture requires aligning with the mesh (typically if one of the texture
 * dimensions is not a power-of-two), you should invoke one of the alignWithTexture...
 * or alignWithInvertedTexture... methods before invoking this method.
 *
 * In the example above, you would invoke one of those methods before invoking this
 * method, to first align the mesh with that non-power-of-two side.
 *
 * The dimensions of the repeatFactor are independent of the size specified in the
 * alignWithTextureMapSize: and alignWithInvertedTextureMapSize: methods, or derived
 * from the texture by the alignWithTexture or alignWithInvertedTexture methods.
 * A value of 1.0 for an element in the specified repeatFactor will automatically
 * take into consideration the adjustment made to the mesh by those methods, and will
 * display only the part of the texture defined by them.
 *
 * You can specify a fractional value for either of the components of the repeatFactor
 * to expand the texture in that dimension so that only part of the texture appears
 * in that dimension, while potentially repeating multiple times in the other dimension.
