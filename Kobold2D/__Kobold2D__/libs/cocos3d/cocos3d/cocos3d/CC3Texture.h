/** 
 * Each instance of CC3Texture wraps a cocos2d CCTexture2D instance, and manages
 * applying that texture to the GL engine.
 *
 * In most cases, a material will hold a single instance of CC3Texture in the texture
 * property to provide a simple single-texture surface. This is the most common application
 * of textures to a material.
 *
 * For more sophisticated surfaces, materials also support multi-texturing, where more than
 * one instance of CC3Texture is added to the material. With multi-texturing, several textures
 * can be combined in flexible, customized fashion, permitting sophisticated surface effects.
 *
 * With OpenGL, multi-texturing is processed by a chain of texture units. The material's
 * first texture is processed by the first texture unit (texture unit zero), and subsequent
 * textures held in the material are processed by subsequent texture units, in the order in
 * which the textures were added to the material.
 * 
 * Each texture unit combines its texture with the output of the previous texture unit
 * in the chain. Combining textures is quite flexible under OpenGL, and there are many
 * ways that each texture can be combined with the output of the previous texture unit.
 * The way that a particular texture combines with the previous textures is defined by
 * an instance of CC3TextureUnit, held in the textureUnit property of each texture that
 * was added to the material.
 *
 * For example, to configure a material for bump-mapping, add a texture that contains a
 * normal vector at each pixel instead of a color, and set the textureUnit property of
 * the texture to a CC3BumpMapTextureUnit. Then add another texture, containing the image
 * that will be visible, to the material. The material will combine these two textures,
 * as specified by the CC3TextureUnit held by the second texture.

 * The texture unit can be used to configure how the texture will be combined with other

 * texture should contain a texture unit that describes how the GL engine should combine
 * that texture with the textures that have already been applied.
