/**
 * A CC3Node that draws a 3D mesh.
 * This class forms the base of all visible 3D mesh models in the 3D world.
 *
 * CC3MeshNode is a type of CC3Node, and will often participate in a structural
 * node assembly. An instance can be the child of another node, and the mesh node
 * itself can have child nodes.
 *
 * CC3MeshNodes encapsulate a CC3Mesh instance, and can also encapsulate either
 * a CC3Material instance, or a pure color. The CC3Mesh instance contains the
 * mesh vertex data. The CC3Material instance describes the material and texture
 * properties covering the mesh, which are affected by lighting conditions.
 * Alternately, instead of a material, the mesh may be colored by a single pure color
 * via the pureColor property.
 *
 * There are a number of populateAs... parametric population methods available in
 * the CC3MeshNode (ParametricShapes) category extension. These methods can be used
 * to populate the vertices of the mesh contained in a new mesh node to create
 * interesting and useful parametric shapes and surfaces.
 *
 * When this node is drawn, it delegates to the mesh instance to render the mesh
 * vertices. If a material is defined, before drawing the mesh, it delegates to the
 * material to configure the covering of the mesh. If no material is defined, the node
 * establishes its pure color before rendering the mesh. The pure color is only used
 * if the node has no material attached. And the pure color may in turn be overridden
 * by the mesh data if vertex coloring is in use.
 *
 * Each CC3MeshNode can have only one material or pure color. For large, complicated
 * meshes that are covered by more than one material, or colored with more than one
 * color, the mesh must be broken into smaller meshes, each of which are covered by
 * a single material or color. These smaller sub-meshes are sometimes referred to as
 * "vertex groups". Each such sub-mesh is then wrapped in its own CC3MeshNode instance,
 * along with the material that covers that sub-mesh.
 *
 * These CC3MeshNode instances can then be added as child nodes to a single parent
 * CC3Node instance. This parent CC3Node can then be moved, rotated and scaled,
 * and all of its child nodes will transform in sync. The assembly will behave and
 * be seen as a single object.
 *
 * When the mesh is set in the mesh property, the CC3MeshNode instance creates and
 * builds a CC3NodeBoundingVolume instance from the mesh data, and sets it into its
 * boundingVolume property. 
 *
 * When a copy is made of a CC3MeshNode instance using the copy method, a copy is
 * made of the material, but the mesh is simply assigned by reference, and
 * is not copied. The result is that the the new and original nodes will have
 * different materials, but will share the same mesh. This design avoids
 * creating multiple copies of volumnious and static mesh data when creating
 * copies of nodes.
 *
 * Normally, the front faces of a mesh are displayed, and the back faces are culled
 * and not displayed. You can change this behaviour if you need to be changing the
 * values of the shouldCullFrontFaces and shouldCullBackFaces properties. An example
 * might be if you wanted to show the back-side of a planar sign, or if you wanted
 * to show the inside faces of a skybox.
 *
 * However, be aware that culling is a significant performance-improving technique.
 * You should avoid disabling backface culling except where specifically needed for
 * visual effect. And when you do, if you only need the back faces, turn on front
 * face culling for that mesh by setting the shouldCullFrontFaces property to YES.

/**

 * the texture should be repeated.
 * 
 * As an example, a value of (1, 2) for the repeatValue indicates that the texture
 * should repeat twice vertically, but not repeat horizontally.
 * 
 * When a texture is repeated, the corresponding side of the texture covering this
 * mesh must have a length that is a power-of-two, otherwise the padding added by
 * iOS to convert it to a power-of-two length internally will be visible in the
 * repeating pattern across the mesh.
 *
 * For a side that is not repeating, the corresponding side of the texture covering
 * this mesh does not require a length that is a power-of-two.
 *
 * The textureParameters property of any texture covering this mesh should include
 * the GL_REPEAT setting in each of its texture wrap components that correspond to
 * a repeatFactor greater than one. The GL_REPEAT setting is the default setting
 * for CC3Texture.
 *
 * For example, if you want to repeat your texture twice in one dimension, but only
 * once in the other, then you would use a repeatFactor of (1, 2) or (2, 1). For the
 * side that is repeating twice, the length of that side of the texture must be a
 * power-of-two. But the other side may have any dimension. The textureParameters
 * property of the CC3Texture should include the GL_REPEAT setting for the
 * corresponding texture dimension.
 *
 * If your texture requires aligning with the mesh (typically if one of the texture
 * dimensions is not a power-of-two), you should invoke either the alignTextures or
 * alignInvertedTextures method before invoking this method.
 *
 * In the example above, you would invoke one of those methods before invoking this
 * method, to first align the mesh with that non-power-of-two side.
 *
 * The dimensions of the repeatFactor are independent of the size derived from the
 * texture by the alignTextures or alignInvertedTextures methods. A value of 1.0 for
 * an element in the specified repeatFactor will automatically take into consideration
 * the adjustment made to the mesh by those methods, and will display only the part of
 * the texture defined by them.
 *
 * You can specify a fractional value for either of the components of the repeatFactor
 * to expand the texture in that dimension so that only part of the texture appears
 * in that dimension, while potentially repeating multiple times in the other dimension.

/**
 * Defines the rectangular area of the textures, for all texture units, that should
 * be mapped to the mesh used by this node.
 *
 * This property facilitates the use of sprite-sheets, where the mesh is covered
 * by a small fraction of a larger texture. This technique has many uses, including
 * animating a texture onto a mesh, where each section of the full texture is really
 * a different frame of a texture animation, or simply loading one larger texture
 * and using parts of it to texture many different meshes.
 *
 * The dimensions of this rectangle are taken as fractional portions of the full
 * area of the texture. Therefore, a rectangle with zero origin, and unit size
 * ((0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 1.0)) indicates that the mesh should be covered with the
 * complete texture.
 * 
 * A rectangle of smaller size, and/or a non-zero origin, indicates that the mesh
 * should be covered by a fractional area of the texture. For example, a rectangular
 * value for this property with origin at (0.5, 0.5), and size of (0.5, 0.5) indicates
 * that only the top-right quarter of the texture will be used to cover this mesh.
 *
 * The bounds of the texture rectangle must fit within a unit rectangle. Both the
 * bottom-left and top-right corners must lie between zero and one in both the
 * X and Y directions.
 *
 * The dimensions of the rectangle in this property are independent of adjustments
 * made by the  alignTextures and alignInvertedTextures methods. A unit rectangle
 * value for this property will automatically take into consideration the adjustment
 * made to the mesh by those methods, and will display only the part of the texture
 * defined by them. Rectangular values for this property that are smaller than the
 * unit rectangle will be relative to the displayable area defined by alignTextures
 * and alignInvertedTextures.
 *
 * As an example, if the alignWithTexturesIn: method was used to limit the mesh
 * to using only 80% of the texture (perhaps when using a non-POT texture), and this
 * property was set to a rectangle with origin at (0.5, 0.0) and size (0.5, 0.5),
 * the mesh will be covered by the bottom-right quarter of the usable 80% of the
 * overall texture.
 *
 * This property affects all texture units used by this mesh, to query or change
 * this property for a single texture unit only, use the textureRectangleForTextureUnit:
 * and setTextureRectangle:forTextureUnit: methods.
 *
 * The initial value of this property is a rectangle with origin at zero, and unit
 * size, indicating that the mesh will be covered with the complete usable area of
 * the texture.
