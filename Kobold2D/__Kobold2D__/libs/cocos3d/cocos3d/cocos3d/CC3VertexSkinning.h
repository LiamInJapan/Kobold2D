#pragma mark CC3SoftBodyNode

/**
 * CC3SoftBodyNode is the primary structural component for a soft-body object that
 * uses vertex skinning to manipulate and draw mesh vertices.
 *
 * Vertex skinning is a feature of OpenGL that allows the vertices of a mesh to be
 * manipulated or deformed using an underlying skeleton of bones. This feature is
 * also sometimes referred to as bone-rigging. This feature is used to create
 * realistic movement in soft-body, flexible meshes, such as characters or textiles.
 *
 * A soft-body object consists of two primary components: a skeletal structure, and
 * the skin that covers it. The skeletal structure is constructed from an assembly
 * of CC3Bone instances, and the skin is constructed from one or more CC3SkinMeshNode
 * instances. The CC3SoftBodyNode instance then serves to collect together the bones
 * and skin components, and forms the root of the soft-body object.
 * 
 * The vertices of the skin mesh forms the skin that surrounds the bones of the skeleton.
 * During movement and drawing, the location and rotation of each bone in the skeleton
 * influences the locations of the skin vertices that are attached to that bone.
 * Some skin vertices, particularly those around joints where two bones meet, can be
 * associated with more than one bone, and in that case, the influence that each bone
 * has on the location of a vertex is determined by a weighting associated with each
 * bone for that vertex.
 *
 * The CC3Bone instances are typically assembled into a structural assembly of bones
 * known as a skeleton. The purpose of this skeletal structure is to allow the bones
 * to move and interact with each other in a hierarchical manner.
 *
 * A CC3SkinMeshNode instance represents the skin that covers the skeleton, and contains
 * the mesh that makes up the skin, in the form of a CC3SkinMesh. This mesh includes the
 * bone assignments and weights for each vertex, which specifies how the location of each
 * vertex is influenced by the location and orientation of each nearby bone.
 *
 * A single soft-body object may be covered by a single skin mesh, but more complicated
 * objects may be covered by several skin meshes. As such, a single CC3SoftBodyNode
 * instance may contain one or more CC3SkinMeshNode instances.
 * 
 * For efficiency and control, each skin mesh is usually broken into sections. These skin
 * sections are represented by instances of the CC3SkinSection class. A CC3SkinMeshNode
 * typically holds a single CC3SkinMesh, and several CC3SkinSection instances to define
 * how that skin mesh should be divided into sections. Each CC3SkinSection instance
 * contains a range of vertices, and references to the bones in the skeleton that
 * influence the vertices in that range. All of the vertices of a single CC3SkinSection
 * are drawn in a single GL drawing call.
 *
 * Manipulation of the bones in the skeleton will cause the soft-body to move and flex
 * internally. In addition, like any node, a CC3SoftBodyNode can be moved, rotated and
 * scaled to move, rotate and scale the entire soft-body assembly of skin and bones as
 * a unit. By combining both internal bone animation with movement of the entire
 * CC3SoftBodyNode, you can create realistic movement of your soft-body objects.
 *
 * For example, if your CC3SoftBodyNode represents a character, you could animate the
 * bones in the skeleton within the node to crouch down and then stand up again.
 * During the standing up animation, you could move the entire CC3SoftBodyNode upwards
 * to create a realistic jumping action. Or, you could simply animate the bones in the
 * skeleton through a loop of a step of a walking motion, while at the same time moving
 * the CC3SoftBodyNode forward, making it appear that the character was walking forward.
 *
 * The initial assembly of CC3Bone nodes should be arranged into what is termed the
 * "rest pose". This is the alignment of the bones that will fit the undeformed
 * positions of the vertices that make up the skin. In the rest pose, the bones have
 * no deforming effect on the skin vertices.
 * 
 * Once the initial skeleton has been assembled into the rest pose, you should invoke
 * the bindRestPose method on the CC3SoftBodyNode instance (or any ancestor node of the
 * CC3SoftBodyNode instance) to cause the bones and skin (CC3Bones & CC3SkinMeshNodes)
 * to cache this pose.
 * 
 * Subsequent movement of the bones in the skeleton deform the skin vertices relative
 * to this rest pose, affecting the location of the vertices in the mesh.
 *
 * In almost all soft-body objects, all internal movement of the object is handled via
 * manipulation of the bones. The CC3SkinMeshNodes should not be moved or rotated directly,
 * otherwise the skin will become detached from the bones. However, if you have reason to
 * move the skin mesh nodes, you should re-establish the rest pose and invoke the
 * bindRestPose method again to re-align the bones with the skin.
 *
 * If the CC3SoftBodyNode has been assembled from a file loader, the bindRestPose method
 * will be invoked automatically, and you do not need to invoke it explicitly.

/**
 * CC3SkinMeshNode is a CC3MeshNode specialized to use vertex skinning to draw the
 * contents of its mesh. It is one of the key structural descendant nodes of a
 * CC3SoftBodyNode instance.
 *
 * Like all mesh nodes, a CC3SkinMeshNode contains a material and a mesh. For a
 * CC3SkinMeshNode, the mesh must be a CC3SkinMesh, which manages the mesh vertices, 
 * including the vertex weights that determine, for each vertex, how the location
 * of that vertex is influenced by the location and orientation of each skeleton bone.
 *
 * This CC3MeshNode subclass adds a number of methods for accessing and managing the
 * weights and matrix index data associated with each vertex.
 *
 * In addition, the CC3SkinMeshNode contains a collection of skin sections, in the
 * form of CC3SkinSection instances. Each CC3SkinSection instance relates a section of
 * the mesh, in the form of a range of vertices, to a set of bones in the skeleton.
 * 
 * Each CC3SkinSection applies the transformations in the referenced bones to the
 * the vertices in the section of the mesh that it controls, and draws that section
 * of the mesh by drawing the vertices within its range in a single GL call.
 * 
 * After copying a CC3SkinMeshNode, the newly created copy will still be influenced
 * by the original skeleton. The result is that both the original mesh and the copy
 * will move and be deformed in tandem as the skeleton moves.
 *
 * If you are creating a chorus line of dancing characters, this may be the effect
 * you are after. However, if you are creating a squadron of similar, but independently
 * moving characters, each CC3SkinMeshNode copy should be controlled by a separate skeleton.
 * 
 * After creating a copy of the skeleton bone node assembly as well, you can use the
 * reattachBonesFrom: method to attach the skin mesh node to the new skeleton.
 *
 * When copying a CC3SkinMeshNode as part of copying a CC3SoftBodyNode instance, a copy
 * of the skeleton is also created, and the reattachBonesFrom: method is automatically
 * invoked. When copying CC3SoftBodyNode, you do not need to invoke the reattachBonesFrom:

 *
 * Each element of the CC3VertexMatrixIndices vertex array in the boneMatrixIndices property

 * the bones identified in the boneMatrixIndices has on transforming the location of the vertex.
 * 
 * For each vertex, there is a one-to-one correspondence between each bone index values
 * and the weights. The first weight is applied to the bone identified by the first index.
 * Therefore, the elementSize property of the vertex arrays in the boneWeights and

 * therefore effectively defines how many bones influence each vertex in these arrays, and

#pragma mark Drawing

/**
 * Draws the mesh vertices of this skin section.
 *
 * Prior to drawing the vertices, this method iterates through the CC3Bones in the bones
 * property, and loads a transform matrix into the GL matrix palette for each bone.
 * During drawing, each vertex is then transformed by a weighted average of the transform
 * matrices that it identifies as influencing its location.
 *
 * The actual matrix loaded for each bone is derived from a combination of:
 *   - the modelview matrix of the world (MV)
 *   - the transform of the bone (B), relative to the world
 *   - the inverse transform of rest pose of the bone (Br(-1)), relative to the world
 *   - the transform of the skin mesh node (M)
 * 
 * as follows, with * representing matrix multiplication:
 *
 *   MV * B * Br(-1) * M
 * 
 * In practice, to avoid calculating the inverse transform for the rest pose of each bone
 * on every frame render, we can separate each of the rest pose of the bone and the skin
 * mesh node into two components: the transform of the CC3SoftBodyNode, relative to the
 * world, and the transform of the bone and skin mesh node relative to the CC3SoftBodyNode.
 * The above matrix calculation can be expanded and then reduced as follows, with:
 *   - the modelview matrix of the world (MV)
 *   - the transform of the bone (B)
 *   - the transform of the Soft-body node (SB), and its inverse (SB(-1))
 *   - the transform of the rest pose of the bone relative to the
 *     soft-body node (Brsb), and its inverse (Brsb(-1))
 *   - the transform of the skin mesh node relative to the soft-body node (Msb)
 *
 *   MV * B * Br(-1) * M
 *   MV * B * (SB * Brsb)(-1) * (SB * Msb)
 *   MV * B * Brsb(-1) * SB(-1) * SB * Msb
 *   MV * B * Brsb(-1) * (SB(-1) * SB) * Msb
 *   MV * B * Brsb(-1) * Msb
 *
 * The result is dependent only on the inverted rest pose of the bone relative to
 * the soft-body node, and the skin mesh node, also relative to the soft-body node.
 * In practice, neither of these parameters should change as the character moves.
 *
 * Since the two cached matrices are relative to the soft-body node, we can move the
 * soft-body node around, and transform it, without having to recalculate the inverse
 * rest pose matrix on each movement for each bone. The movement of the soft-body node
 * and the bones are the only factors that need to be rebuilt on each update.
 *
 * We can capture the inverse rest pose transform of the bone relative to the soft-body
 * node once and cache it. If we make the assumption that the transform of the skin mesh
 * node, relative to the soft-body node will not change (a fairly safe assumption since
 * it would affect the alignment of the bones to the mesh vertices), we can determine it
 * once and cache it as well. This caching is handled by the bindRestPose method on the
 * respective CC3Bone and CC3SkinMeshNode nodes.
 *
 * This arrangement also has the benefit of avoiding artifacts that sometimes appear
 * in the matrix inversion of the full bone and skin transforms if the CC3SoftBodyNode
 * is set at rotations of exactly 90 degrees (the cosine of the angle is zero).
 * 
 * This method is invoked automatically when a CC3SkinMeshNode is drawn. Usually, the
 * application never needs to invoke this method directly.

/**
 * CC3Bone is the building block of skeletons that control the deformation of a skin mesh.
 *
 * When building a skeleton, bones are assembled in a structural assembly, from a root bone
 * out to limb or branch bones. For example, a skeleton for a human character might start
 * with a root spine bone, to which are attached upper-arm and thigh bones, to which are
 * attached, forearm and shin bones, to which are attached hand and foot bones, and so on.
 *
 * In this structual assembly, moving an upper-arm bone to cause the character to reach
 * out, carries the forearm and hand bones along with it. Movement of the forearm bone
 * is then performed relative to the upper-arm bone, and movement of the hand bone is
 * performed relative to the forearm, and so on.
 *
 * CC3Bones are simply specialized structural nodes, and have no content of their own to
 * draw. However, individual bones are referenced by skin sections of the skin mesh node,
 * and the transform matrices of the bones influence the transformations of the vertices
 * of the skin mesh, as the skeleton moves. The applyPoseTo: method handles applying the
 * transform matrix of the bone to the transform matrix for the skin mesh vertices.
