/**
 * Bounding volumes are used by CC3Nodes to determine whether a node interset the camera's
 * frustum, or to determine boundaries for collision detection during physics simulation.
 * Many different shapes of boundaries are available, including points, spheres, bounding
 * boxes, etc, permitting tradeoffs between accuracy and computational processing time.
 *
 * This base bounding volume is simply a single point. When applied to a node, it indicates
 * that the node intersects the frustum if the node's center of geometry is within the frustum.
 *
 * For meshes, the center of geometry is calculated from the vertex locations, via specialized
 * subclasses of CC3NodeBoundingVolume. For other nodes, it can be set directly within the
 * bounding volume via the centerOfGeometry property.

/**
 * If the value of this property is set to YES, the boundary of this volume will only

 * vertex data.
 * 
 * The shape of the boundary depends on the subclass. Whenever this bounding volume is
 * rebuilt, the resulting boundary is compared to the previous boundary, and replaces
 * the previous boundary only if it is larger.
 *
 * Rebuilding occurs whenever the update method is invoked and this bounding volume has
 * previously been marked as dirty via the markDirty method. Rebuilding also occurs
 * directly when the markDirtyAndUpdate method is invoked.
 *
 * Rebuilding occurs under control of the node, when the rebuildBoundingVolume method
 * of the node is invoked and the shouldUseFixedBoundingVolume of the node is set to NO.
 * Typically, the node invokes the rebuildBoundingVolume method whenever the vertex
 * location data in the underlying mesh has changed.
 *
 * Setting this property to YES and the shouldUseFixedBoundingVolume of the node to NO
 * can be useful when pre-computing an appropriate fixed boundary for a node whose vertex
 * location data frequently changes, such as a particle generator, and is often used at
 * development time.
 *
 * Once the resulting maximized boundary is determined, it can then be explicitly set
 * into this bounding volume at run time, and the shouldUseFixedBoundingVolume of the
 * node can be set to YES so that the processing cost of constantly rebuilding this
 * bounding volume will not be incurred.
 * 
 * If a dynamic boundary is required at runtime, set both the shouldUseFixedBoundingVolume
 * of the node and this property to NO. With a dynamic boundary, setting this property
 * to YES has no advantage. The performance cost will be the same, and the resulting
 * boundary will be less accurate.
