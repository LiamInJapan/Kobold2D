/**
 * A CC3Mesh holds the 3D mesh for a CC3MeshNode. The CC3MeshNode enapsulates a reference
 * to the CC3Mesh.
 *
 * In 3D models, the mesh generally remains fixed, and transformations such as translation,
 * rotation, and scaling are applied at the node level. A single CC3Mesh instance, which
 * typically contains a large set of data points, can be used by many nodes simultaneously,
 * and each node instance can be transformed, colored, and textured independently.
 *
 * With this in mind, and following best practices to consevere memory and processing time,
 * you should strive to create only one CC3Mesh instance for each distinct mesh in your
 * application, and assign that single CC3Mesh instance to any number of separate
 * CC3MeshNode instances that make use of it.
 *
 * When drawing the mesh to the GL engine, this class remembers which mesh was last drawn
 * and only binds the mesh data to the GL engine when a different mesh is drawn. This allows
 * the application to organize the CC3MeshNodes within the CC3World so that nodes using the
 * same mesh are drawn together, before moving on to other mesh models. This strategy
 * can minimize the number of mesh switches in the GL engine, which improves performance. 
 *
 * CC3Mesh is an abstract class. Subclasses can be created for loading and managing
 * meshes from different sources and third-party libraries.

/**

 * the texture should be repeated.
 * 
 * As an example, a value of (1, 2) for the repeatValue indicates that the texture
 * should repeat twice vertically, but not repeat horizontally.
 * 
 * When a texture is repeated, the corresponding side of the texture covering this
 * mesh must have a length that is a power-of-two, otherwise the padding added by
 * iOS to convert it to a power-of-two length internally will be visible in the
 * repeating pattern across the mesh.
 *
 * For a side that is not repeating, the corresponding side of the texture covering
 * this mesh does not require a length that is a power-of-two.
 *
 * The textureParameters property of any texture covering this mesh should include
 * the GL_REPEAT setting in each of its texture wrap components that correspond to
 * a repeatFactor greater than one. The GL_REPEAT setting is the default setting
 * for CC3Texture.
 *
 * For example, if you want to repeat your texture twice in one dimension, but only
 * once in the other, then you would use a repeatFactor of (1, 2) or (2, 1). For the
 * side that is repeating twice, the length of that side of the texture must be a
 * power-of-two. But the other side may have any dimension. The textureParameters
 * property of the CC3Texture should include the GL_REPEAT setting for the
 * corresponding texture dimension.
 *
 * If your texture requires aligning with the mesh (typically if one of the texture
 * dimensions is not a power-of-two), you should invoke either the alignWithTexturesIn:
 * or alignWithInvertedTexturesIn: method before invoking this method.
 *
 * In the example above, you would invoke one of those methods before invoking this
 * method, to first align the mesh with that non-power-of-two side.
 *
 * The dimensions of the repeatFactor are independent of the size derived from the
 * texture by the alignWithTexturesIn: or alignWithInvertedTexturesIn: methods.
 * A value of 1.0 for an element in the specified repeatFactor will automatically take
 * into consideration the adjustment made to the mesh by those methods, and will display
 * only the part of the texture defined by them.
 *
 * You can specify a fractional value for either of the components of the repeatFactor
 * to expand the texture in that dimension so that only part of the texture appears
 * in that dimension, while potentially repeating multiple times in the other dimension.

/**
 * Defines the rectangular area of the textures, for all texture units, that should
 * be mapped to this mesh.
 *
 * This property facilitates the use of sprite-sheets, where the mesh is covered
 * by a small fraction of a larger texture. This technique has many uses, including
 * animating a texture onto a mesh, where each section of the full texture is really
 * a different frame of a texture animation, or simply loading one larger texture
 * and using parts of it to texture many different meshes.
 *
 * The dimensions of this rectangle are taken as fractional portions of the full
 * area of the texture. Therefore, a rectangle with zero origin, and unit size
 * ((0.0, 0.0), (1.0, 1.0)) indicates that the mesh should be covered with the
 * complete texture.
 * 
 * A rectangle of smaller size, and/or a non-zero origin, indicates that the mesh
 * should be covered by a fractional area of the texture. For example, a rectangular
 * value for this property with origin at (0.5, 0.5), and size of (0.5, 0.5) indicates
 * that only the top-right quarter of the texture will be used to cover this mesh.
 *
 * The bounds of the texture rectangle must fit within a unit rectangle. Both the
 * bottom-left and top-right corners must lie between zero and one in both the
 * X and Y directions.
 *
 * The dimensions of the rectangle in this property are independent of adjustments
 * made by the  alignWithTexturesIn: and alignWithInvertedTexturesIn: methods.
 * A unit rectangle value for this property will automatically take into
 * consideration the adjustment made to the mesh by those methods, and will display
 * only the part of the texture defined by them. Rectangular values for this property
 * that are smaller than the unit rectangle will be relative to the displayable area
 * defined by alignWithTexturesIn: and alignWithInvertedTexturesIn:.
 *
 * As an example, if the alignWithTexturesIn: method was used to limit the mesh
 * to using only 80% of the texture (perhaps when using a non-POT texture), and this
 * property was set to a rectangle with origin at (0.5, 0.0) and size (0.5, 0.5),
 * the mesh will be covered by the bottom-right quarter of the usable 80% of the
 * overall texture.
 *
 * This property affects all texture units used by this mesh, to query or change
 * this property for a single texture unit only, use the textureRectangleForTextureUnit:
 * and setTextureRectangle:forTextureUnit: methods.
 *
 * The initial value of this property is a rectangle with origin at zero, and unit
