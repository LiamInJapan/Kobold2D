/**
 * CC3Node and its subclasses form the basis of all 3D artifacts in the 3D world, including
 * visible meshes, structures, cameras, lights, resources, and the 3D world itself.
 *
 * Nodes can be moved, rotated and scaled. Rotation can be specified via either Euler angles
 * or quaternions.
 *
 * Nodes can be assembled in a structural hierarchy of parents and children, and transformations
 * that are applied to a node are also applied to its descendant nodes. Typically, the root
 * of a structural node hierarchy is an instance of CC3World.
 *
 * Each node is automatically touched at two distinct times during animation frame handling.
 * First, the updateBeforeTransform: and updateAfterTransform: methods are each invoked during
 * scheduled model state updating, before and after the transformation matrix of the node is
 * rebuilt, respectively. You should override udpateBeforeTransform: method to make any changes
 * to the node, or its child nodes.
 * 
 * You should override updateAfterTransform: only if you need to make use of the global
 * properties of the node or its child nodes, such as globalLocation, globalRotation, or
 * globalScale. These properties are valid only after the transformMatrix has been
 * calculated, and are therefore not valid within the updateBeforeTransform: method.
 * However, if you make any changes to the transform properties (location, rotation, scale)
 * of a node within the updateAfterTransform: method, you must invoke the updateTransformMatrices
 * method on that node in order to have the changes applied to the node's transformMatrix.
 * 
 * Note that you do NOT need to invoke the updateTransformMatrices method for any changes
 * made in the updateBeforeTransform: method, since those changes will automatically be
 * applied to the transformMatrix.
 *
 * The second place a node is touched is, the transformAndDrawWithVisitor: method,
 * which is automaticaly invoked during each frame rendering cycle. You should have
 * no need to override this method.
 * 
 * To maximize throughput, the operations of updating model state should be kept
 * separate from the operations of frame rendering, and the two should not be mixed.
 * Subclasses should respect this design pattern when overriding behaviour. Drawing
 * operations should not be included in state updating, and vice versa. Since OpenGL is
 * a hardware-accelerated state-machine pipeline, this separation allows frame-drawing
 * operations to be performed by the GPU at the same time that state update operations for
 * the next frame are being handled by the CPU, and on some systems, permits frame drawing
 * and model updating to be perfomed on separate threads.
 *
 * CC3Nodes support the cocos2d CCAction class hierarchy. Nodes can be translated, rotated,
 * and scaled in three dimensions, or made to point towards a direction (for cameras and
 * lights), all under control of cocos2d CCActions. As with other CCActions, these actions
 * can be combined into action sequences or repeating actions, or modified with cocos2d
 * ease actions. See the class CC3TransformTo and its subclasses for actions that operate
 * on CC3Nodes.
 *
 * When populating your world, you can easily create hordes of similar nodes using the copy
 * and copyWithName: methods. Those methods effect deep copies to allow each copy to be
 * manipulated independently, but will share underlying mesh data for efficient memory use.
 * See the notes at the copy method for more details about copying nodes.
 *
 * You can animate this class with animation data held in a subclass of CC3NodeAnimation.
 * To animate this node using animation data, set the animation property to an instance of
 * a subclass of the abstract CC3NodeAnimation class, populated with animation data, and
 * then create an instance of a CC3Animate action, and run it on this node.
 *
 * Nodes can respond to iOS touch events. The property isTouchEnabled can be set to YES
 * to allow a node to be selected by a touch event. If the shouldInheritTouchability
 * property is also set to YES, then this touchable capability can also be inherited from
 * a parent node. Selection of nodes based on touch events is handled by CC3World. The
 * nodeSelected:byTouchEvent:at: callback method of your customized CC3World will be
 * invoked to indicate which node has been touched.
 *
 * The iOS and PVR hardware expects textures to have width and height values that are a
 * power-of-two (POT). If you are using textures that do not have POT dimensions, they will
 * be converted to POT by the texture loader. If the corresponding mesh was not created in
 * your 3D editor with this taken into consideration, you might find that the texture does
 * not completely cover the mesh as expected. If this situation arises, you can compensate
 * with the alignTextures and alignInvertedTextures methods to realign the texture coordinate
 * arrays with the textures.
 *
 * You can cause a wireframe box to be drawn around the node and all its descendants by
 * setting the shouldDrawWireframeBox property to YES. This can be particularly useful
 * during development to locate the boundaries of a node, or to locate a node that is not
 * drawing properly. You can set the default color of this wireframe using the class-side
 * defaultWireframeBoxColor property.
 *
 * To maximize GL throughput, all OpenGL ES 1.1 state is tracked by the singleton instance
 * [CC3OpenGLES11Engine engine]. CC3OpenGLES11Engine only sends state change calls to the
 * GL engine if GL state really is changing. It is critical that all changes to GL state
 * are made through the CC3OpenGLES11Engine singleton. When adding or overriding functionality
 * in this framework, do NOT make gl* function calls directly if there is a corresponding
 * state change tracker in the CC3OpenGLES11Engine singleton. Route the state change request
 * through the CC3OpenGLES11Engine singleton instead.

/**
 * Indicates a tolerance value that is used when testing scale component values,
 * including testing whether a component value is close to unity (one), or whether
 * two component values are close to each other (uniformity).
 *
 * Exact unity scaling is useful because an unscaled (rigid) transform matrix can be
 * inverted much faster than a scaled transform matrix, by a factor of between one and
 * two orders of magnitude. If it is known that the transform matrix includes no scaling
 * (has unity scaling), then the matrix will be inverted as a rigid matrix, to make use
 * of this performance gain during inversion.
 *
 * In addition, exact uniform scaling is useful when determining the method used to
 * rescaling vertex normals during mesh transformations. The methods used if the
 * transform includes no scaling, or if the transform includes only uniform scaling,
 * are significantly faster than if the transform includes non-uniform scaling.
 *
 * Although you can often deliberately set the scaling to exactly unity, or to be
 * exactly uniform, there are some occasions, including animation and automatic
 * physics, where the scale can be close to, but not exactly zero. By permitting
 * a tolerance, unity scaling or uniform scaling can be assumed if the values are
 * reasonably close, and the performance gain can be acquired under a wider range
 * of conditions.
 *
 * Specifically, the isTransformRigid will return YES if each of the X, Y & Z
 * components of the scale property are within the tolerance range defined by
 * this property, when comparing the components to unity.
 *
 * For example, if the value of this property is 0.02, and the value of the scale
 * property is (1.01, 1.0, 1.02), the isTransformRigid will return YES. However, if
 * the value of this property was left at zero, the isTransformRigid property would
 * return NO with the same scale value.
 *
 * This property is also used by the isUniformlyScaledLocally and isUniformlyScaledGlobally
 * properties when testing whether the components of the scale property are equal to each
 * other, for the purpose of determining whether the scaling is uniform.
 *
 * For example, if the value of this property is 0.02 and the value of the scale property
 * is (3.01, 3.0, 3.02), the isUniformlyScaledLocally property will return YES, as will
 * the isUniformlyScaledGlobally, if the ancestor scales are similarly uniform.
 *
 * If this property is set to zero, then no tolerance is accepted, and all three
 * components of the scale property must be exactly equal to one for this node to
 * be considered to have no scaling applied, or exactly equal to each other for
 * this node to be considered to have uniform scaling.
 * 
 * Setting this property sets the same property in all child nodes to the same value.

 *     into vectors that are not of unit length.
 *   - If the transforms are not rigid, and include scaling, even normals that have unit
 *     length in object space will end up shorter or longer than unit length in eye space.
 *   - If the transform scaling is not uniform, the normals will shear, and end up shorter
 *     or longer than unit length.
 *
 * Normals that are not of unit length, or are sheared, will cause portions of the objects
 * to appear lighter or darker after transformation, or will cause specular highlights to
 * actually be dark, distorting the overall look of the material covering the mesh.
 *
 * The GL engine can be instructed to compensate for these transforms by setting this
 * property as follows:
 *
 *   - kCC3NormalScalingNone:
 *     No compensating scaling is performed on the normals after they have been transformed.
 *     This has the highest performance, but will not adjust the normals if they have been
 *     scaled. Use this option if you know that the normals will not be significantly scaled
 *     during transformation.
 *
 *   - kCC3NormalScalingRescale:
 *     Uses the modelview matrix to scale all normals by the inverse of the node's overall
 *     scaling. This does have a processing cost, but is much faster than using 
 *     kCC3NormalScalingNormalize. However, it is not as accurate if significantly non-uniform
 *     scaling has been applied to the node.
 *
 *   - kCC3NormalScalingNormalize:
 *     Normalizes each norml vector independently. This is the most accurate method, but is
 *     also, by far, the most computationally expensive. Use this method only if selecting
 *     one of the other options does not give you the results that you expect.
 *
 *   - kCC3NormalScalingAutomatic:
 *     Chooses the most appropriate method based on the scaling that has been applied to the
 *     node. If no scaling has been applied to the node, kCC3NormalScalingNone will be used.
 *     If only uniform scaling has been applied to the node, kCC3NormalScalingRescale will
 *     be used. If non-uniform scaling has been applied to the node, then
 *     kCC3NormalScalingNormalize will be used.
 *
 * The initial value of this property is kCC3NormalScalingAutomatic. You can generally leave
 * this property at this default value unless you are not getting the results that you expect. 
 *
 * Setting this property sets the corresponding property in all descendant nodes, and affects
 * the processing of normals in all vertex meshes contained in all descendant nodes.
 *
 * Querying this property returns the value of this property from the first descendant mesh
 * node, or will return kCC3NormalScalingNone if no mesh node are found in the descendants
 * of this node.

 *     child nodes of the new node will therefore have the same names as the child nodes
 *     of the original node.
 *   - Mesh data is copied by reference, not by value. Child nodes that support mesh data
 *     will assign it by reference when that child is copied. Mesh data is shared between
