/**
 * CC3Camera represents the camera viewing the 3D world.
 *
 * CC3Camera is a type of CC3Node, and can therefore participate in a structural node assembly.
 * An instance can be the child of another node, and the camera itself can have child nodes.
 * For example, a camera can be mounted on a boom object or truck, and will move along with
 * the parent node. Or the camera node itself might have a light node attached as a child,
 * so that the light will move along with the camera, and point where the camera points.
 *
 * However, when adding a camera to an assembly of nodes, be aware of whether the parent
 * nodes use scaling. To construct the modelviewMatrix, the camera makes heavy use of
 * matrix inversion of the cummulative transform matrix of the camera's transforms and
 * the transforms of all its ancestors. If scaling has not been added to any ancestor
 * nodes, the cummulative transform will be a Rigid transform. Inverting a Rigid transform
 * matrix is much, much faster (orders of magnitude) than inverting a matrix that contains
 * scaling and is therefore not rigid. If possible, try to avoid applying scaling to the
 * ancestor nodes of this camera.
 *
 * CC3Camera is also a type of CC3TargettingNode, and can be pointed in a particular
 * direction, or can be made to track a target node as that node moves, or the camera moves.
 *
 * The camera can be configured for either perspective or parallel projection, using
 * the isUsingParallelProjection property. By default, the camera will use perspective
 * projection.
 *
 * You can use the projectLocation: and projectNode: methods to project global locations
 * within the 3D world into 2D view coordinates, indicating where on the screen a 3D
 * object appears.
 *
 * You can use the unprojectPoint: and unprojectPoint:ontoPlane: methods to project a
 * 2D screen position into either a ray (a line) in the 3D world, or into a specific 
 * intersection location on a 3D plane.
 *
 * You can use the  moveToShowAllOf:... or moveWithDuration:toShowAllOf: family of
 * methods to have the camera automatically focus on, and display all of, a particular
 * node, or even the whole world itself.
 *
 * Scaling a camera is a null operation because it scales everything, including the size
 * of objects, but also the distance from the camera to those objects. The effects cancel
 * out, and visually it appears that nothing has changed.
 *
 * Therefore, for cameras, the scale and uniformScale properties are not applied to the
 * transform matrix. Instead, the uniformScale property acts as a zoom factor (as if the
 * camera lens is zoomed in or out), and influences the fieldOfView property accordingly.
 * See the description of the fieldOfView property for more information about zooming.
 *
 * If you find that objects in the periphery of your view appear elongated, you can adjust
 * the fieldOfView and/or uniformScale properties to reduce this "fish-eye" effect.
 * See the notes of the fieldOfView property for more on this.

 *
 * Once a nominal field of view has been set in this property, changing the scale or
 * uniformScale properties will change the effective field of view accordingly (although
 * the value of the fieldOfView property remains the same). Scales greater than one zoom in
 * (objects appear larger), and scales between one and zero zoom out (objects appear smaller).
 *
 * Like real-world cameras, larger values for fieldOfView can sometimes result in a
 * "fish-eye" effect, where objects at the periphery of the view can appear elongated.
 * To reduce this effect, lower the value of fieldOfView property, or increase the value
 * of the uniformScale property. In doing so, you may need to move your camera further
 * away from the scene, so that your view will continue to include the same objects.
