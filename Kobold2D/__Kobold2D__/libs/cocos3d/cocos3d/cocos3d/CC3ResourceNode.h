/**
 * A CC3ResourceNode is a CC3Node that that wraps an instance of a subclass of
 * CC3Resource in the resource property, extracts the nodes from that resource,
 * and forms the root of the resulting node structural assembly.
 *
 * All that is needed is to set the resource property to an instance of a subclass of
 * CC3Resource. Once the resource property has been set, this node can simply be added
 * to a CC3World as a child node. Since the node structural assembly is hierarchical,
 * adding this node to the CC3World will automatically add all the nodes extracted
 * from the 3D data file.
 *
 * There are several ways to instantiate an instance of CC3ResourceNode. The simplest
 * way is to simply use the inherited node class method. Once instantiated, the
 * resource property can be set.
 *
 * There are also several class and instance initialization methods that will
 * load directly from a file and set the resource property from that file.
 * To make use of these methods, this class must be subclassed, and the subclass
 * must override the resourceClass method to indicate witch resource type is to
 * be loaded.
 *
 * When a copy is made of a CC3ResourceNode instance, a copy is not made of the encapsulated
 * CC3Resource instance. Instead, the CC3Resource is retained by reference and shared between
 * both the original CC3ResourceNode, and the new copy.

 * The underlying CC3Resource instance containing the 3D nodes.

 * If this node has not yet been assigned a name, it will be set to the name
 * of the resource when this property is set.
