/**
 * LogGLErrorState logs an ERROR level description of any glError that has occurred
 * since it was last called.
 *
 * Like all logging macros, LogGLErrorState takes a format string and a variable
 * length list of arguments. The GL error code and description is also added to
 * the logged information.
 * 
 * Use the LogGLErrorState() macro and the GL_LOGGING_ENABLED compile switch
 * to turn checking and logging of GL error state. Be sure to set the compiler
 * switch GL_LOGGING_ENABLED to 0 when compiling for production code release,
 * to avoid the overhead of making the GL error state call. This is important
 * to maximize the GL state machine throughput.
