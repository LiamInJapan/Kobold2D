/**
 * CC3Light represents the light in the 3D world.
 *
 * CC3Light is a type of CC3Node, and can therefore participate in a structural node
 * assembly. An instance can be the child of another node, and the light itself can
 * have child nodes. For example, a light can be mounted on a boom object or camera,
 * and will move along with the parent node.
 *
 * CC3Light is also a type of CC3TargettingNode, and can be pointed so that it shines
 * in a particular direction, or can be made to track a target node as that node moves.
 *
 * To turn a CC3Light on or off, set the visible property.
 *
 * The maximum number of lights available is determined by the platform. That number
 * can be retrieved from [CC3OpenGLES11Engine engine].platform.maxLights.value.
 * All platforms support at least eight lights.
 *
 * Lights in different scenes (different instances of CC3World) can have the same
 * GL lightIndex value. Applications that make use of multiple CC3Worlds, either as
 * a sequence of scenes, or as multiple worlds (and multiple CC3Layers) displayed
 * on the screen at once, can reuse a light index across the worlds.
 * The shouldCopyLightIndex property can be used to help copy lights across worlds.
 *
 * If the application uses lights in the 2D world as well, the indexes of those lights
 * can be reserved by invoking the class method setLightPoolStartIndex:. Light indexes
 * reserved for use by the 2D world will not be used by the 3D world.
