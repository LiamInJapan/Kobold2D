* wax_startWithExtension was removed. 
* wax_start's parameters have changed. It now takes the name of the init 
  script usually "AppDelegate.lua". It also contains a null-terminated list of
  extensions. Example below:
  
  wax_start("AppDelegate.lua", luaopen_wax_http);
  
* Wax doesn't look in WAX_ROOT/data/scripts for Lua files anymore. It now 
  searches WAX_ROOT/scripts and then searches the app's Bundle path as well.
  
* Added wax_stdlib.h, this is used in the wax.framework to hold a compiled
  version of the wax stdlib. It's just a dummy file otherwise.
  
* Renamed WAX_ROOT/lib/wax-scripts to WAX_ROOT/lib/stdlib because it was a
  more accurate name.
  
* wax.framework is 100% more awesome. I put a lot of effort into making it
  take as little effort as possible to add to a project. More info

* When developing on the device, you no longer need to clean the build to 
  ensure that the device has the updated files.

* Bug fixes. Mostly dealing with waxClass and inheritance.

* Better C++ compatibility. (via Tawanda Gwena)

* Cross compilation of Lua bytecode files, and the ability to smush all of the
  files together. (thanks to Matt Campbell and Jeremy Collins for their help)
