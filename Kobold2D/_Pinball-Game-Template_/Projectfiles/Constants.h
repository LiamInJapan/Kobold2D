// Pixel to metres ratio. Box2D uses metres as the unit for measurement.
// This ratio defines how many pixels correspond to 1 Box2D "metre"
// Box2D is optimized for objects of 1x1 metre therefore it makes sense
// to define the ratio so that your most common object type is 1x1 metre.
// We use the value set in PhysicsEditor.
// The value must be divided by 2.0 (multiplied with 0.5) because the shapes 
// we used to create the polygons are in highres (Retina display) and 
// cocos2d always uses lowres "points"
